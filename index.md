### Biography

{: .text-justify}
Hello! I am Jingwen Tong, a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I will be an Assistant Professor in the College of Electronics and Information Engineering at Shenzhen University from January 1, 2026.
Before that, I was a visiting scholar at the University of Houston, USA, in 2020. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the School of Informatics at Xiamen University in 2022, and the M.Phil. in Electrical Engineering from Ningbo University in 2018, and the B.E. in Communication Engineering from China Jiliang University in 2015.

{: .text-justify}
My research focuses on LLM-based AI agents and multi-armed bandits (MAB), with applications in wireless communications. I am broadly interested in building learning systems that make sequential decisions under uncertainty, efficiently explore large action spaces, and achieve robust performance in real-world networked environments.

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> This work introduces WirelessAgent, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to create autonomous AI agents for diverse wireless network tasks. It first defines a general framework for WirelessAgent, supported by key components and principles in AI agents. Then, it introduces a basic usage to implement the WirelessAgent based on agentic workflows and the LangGraph architecture. </p>

- **[WRF-GS: Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting (INFOCOM 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04832)** 
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a longstanding challenge. This issue has been escalated due to the denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and wider bandwidth in 5G and beyond networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications.</p>

- **[Intelligent Channel Allocation for IEEE 802.11be Multi-Link Operation: When MAB Meets LLM (JSAC 2025)](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.04594)** 
  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This work addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with multi-link operation capabilities. It formulates this channel allocation problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, which then can be modeled as a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework. It proposes a Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm to solve this MAB problem. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, it put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm.</p>

- **[WirelessLLM: Empowering Large Language Models Towards Wireless Intelligence (JCIN 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17053)**  
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> This paper proposes WirelessLLM, a comprehensive framework for adapting and enhancing LLMs to address the unique challenges and requirements of wireless communication networks. We first identify three foundational principles that underpin WirelessLLM: knowledge alignment, knowledge fusion, and knowledge evolution. Then, we investigate the enabling technologies to build WirelessLLM, including prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, tool usage, multi-modal pre-training, and domain-specific fine-tuning. Moreover, we present three case studies to demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of WirelessLLM for solving typical problems in wireless networks. Finally, we conclude this paper by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research. </p>
