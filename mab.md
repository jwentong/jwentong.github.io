*Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)* is a basic framework for the sequential decisionmaking problem, where a decision-maker (or player) must select an arm from a set of arms with unknown distribution at each time round. After that, the player will observe a reward from the environment. According to the rewarding process,
MABs can be roughly classified into stochastic MABs, adversarial MABs, Markovian MABs, and Contextual MABs.
